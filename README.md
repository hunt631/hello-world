# hello-world
First repository.  Ever.


This is how we're going to learn about Github today.  It's pretty early to be doing this right now but we've got to start sometime!

So, this is known as a BRANCH. Branches are copies of your code that you can make at any given time.  Basically, you have your master code - the good stuff.  If you're feeling frisky and want to try something that might break your code or you want to do something else unorthodox....just to see what might happen....you can create an identical copy of your master code at any given time - a branch.  Branches are revisions of your master code that - once approved - can be merged into a new master copy.  
This way, you can make changes to your code safely. 

Whenever you save a branch, you can make notes about it below the coding box.
